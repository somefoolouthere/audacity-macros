# Music Loudener
Makes music tracks very loud with minimal distortion. In most cases the end result will be around -6 LUFS.

# Versions

## V2
The remake of the macro. It will do a better job with more calm/ambient tracks (less distortion). Currently in beta.

## Normal
The normal (almost obsolete) version of the music loudener.

## Midtones
Reduces treble by 6 dB in the initial decomposition process. In most cases it won't increase treble as much as the normal version.

## Old Version
An older version of the loudener that uses a 1 ms attack time soft limit instead of soft clipping. It reduces crackling in higher frequencies but increases it in lower frequencies. It also has no final extra limiter like in the other versions and is slightly louder.

## Pre-Soft Clip
The normal version of the music loudener that doesn't apply the soft clipper or any other effects after it. This can be used if the other versions cause too much distortion.

## (Very WIP) Radio Edition (RE)
This version will be made for Self Radio in Grand Theft Auto V. It uses a triple banded frequency decomposition and has much more compression compared to the other versions. It's made to be more consistent with Rockstar's method of compressing their radio tracks.

This is currently considered very incomplete and I only uploaded it because I feel like it.

**You must have my Triple Banded Frequency Decompose macro for this to work!**

Note: I seem to have trouble getting it to be similar to Rockstar's method. Help would be appreciated.
