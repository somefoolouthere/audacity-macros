# Ringverb

A reverb effect that increases the audio's speed slightly, causing a cool effect when applied more than once.

## Requirements

## Versions

### Basic

The most basic version there is. It applies a delay with low pass and slightly speeds up audio. This version is meant to be applied more than once.

**This version requires a plugin that doesn't come with Audacity.**

- **3x (Audacity <3.4.0 only): compat/Ringverb Basic 3x.txt**

### HQ

The same as basic, but uses the high quality reverb that comes with Audacity. Doesn't give as good results as basic.

**File names:**

- **1x: Ringverb HQ.txt**
- **2x: Ringverb HQ 2x.txt**
- **3x: Ringverb HQ 3x.txt**
- **1x (Audacity <3.4.0 only): compat/Ringverb HQ.txt**
- **2x (Audacity <3.4.0 only): compat/Ringverb HQ 2x.txt**
- **3x (Audacity <3.4.0 only): compat/Ringverb HQ 3x.txt**

### HQ No Stereo Width

The same as HQ, but there is no stereo width applied. This allows for a greater "flanger" effect. It may sound better than HQ, but still doesn't give as good results as basic.

**File names:**

- **1x: Ringverb HQ NS.txt**
- **2x: Ringverb HQ NS 2x.txt**
- **3x: Ringverb HQ NS 3x.txt**
- **1x (Audacity <3.4.0 only): compat/Ringverb HQ NS.txt**
