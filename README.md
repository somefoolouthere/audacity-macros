# audacity-macros

Some of my personal macros I made for [Audacity](https://github.com/audacity/audacity).

## List of Macros

### [Music Loudener](https://github.com/somefoolouthere/audacity-macros/tree/main/loudness_enhancer)

Makes music tracks really loud with minimal distortion at the cost of some ducking.

### [Rumble Enhancer](https://github.com/somefoolouthere/audacity-macros/tree/main/rumble_enhance)

Applies a distortion effect to low frequencies to add more "effect" to them.

### [Frequency Range Decomposition](https://github.com/somefoolouthere/audacity-macros/tree/main/freq_decompose)

Perfectly separates a track into multiple frequency bands.

### [Ringverb](https://github.com/somefoolouthere/audacity-macros/tree/main/ringverb)

A reverb effect that increases the audio's speed slightly, causing a cool effect when applied more than once.

### [Utility Macros](https://github.com/somefoolouthere/audacity-macros/tree/main/utility)

Macros that can be useful for getting things done.
